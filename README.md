# ResNet training and classification of VPR images
Code used to train ResNet from scratch on Video Plankton Recorder images (.tif files).
This code was used to train ResNet18 and to classify VPR images for a publication, focusing on three classes: Marine snow, Fecal pellets, and Others.

## Prerequisites
- Annotated image data split into "Train" and "Validation" folders
- Requirements.txt
- 

## Features
- Trains a ResNet model from scratch
- Plot performance metrics
- Classify images with GUI (tkinter)
